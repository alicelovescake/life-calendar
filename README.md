# Life Calendar ‚è≥

## What do I do?

This Chrome Extension shows you how much life you have to live when you open a new tab.
Sometimes life seems really short, and other times it seems impossibly long. One thing is for sure. This calendar shows life os most certainly finite. These are your weeks. Are you making the most of them?

## Installation

Download the Chrome Extension from the [Chrome Web Store]

## Inspiration

Inspired by [Tim Urban's Wait But Why Ted Talk] (https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator) and [the Social Media Death Clock Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/social-media-death-clock/jjmjickedeooblgpimknfghpfffncfhb)
